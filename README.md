# 🌍 Global Health & Population Analysis

### 📊 Project Overview
This project is an advanced Data Analysis simulation exploring the relationship between **Socioeconomic Development** and **Public Health** globally.

Using **Power BI**, I built an interactive dashboard that allows users to visualize population distribution and analyze the statistical correlation between **Life Expectancy** and **Infant Mortality**. The report features a custom "Dark Mode" UI for high-contrast monitoring and utilizes Drill-Through features for granular navigation.

### 🖼️ Visual Tour & Analysis

#### 1. Global Demographics (Macro View)
*An interactive geospatial overview of world population density. Designed with a custom dark theme to highlight data clusters effectively.*

#### 2. Statistical Correlation (The Insight)
*Scatter plot analysis revealing the strong inverse correlation between Infant Mortality (X-axis) and Life Expectancy (Y-axis). By visualizing all countries simultaneously, we can identify clear development trends and regional clusters.*

#### 3. Data Engineering (The Backend)
*A robust Data Model (Star Schema) connecting Fact Tables with Dimensions. This structure ensures high-performance filtering and accurate cross-report connections.*
